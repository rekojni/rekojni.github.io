                <div class="fs-5 text-body-secondary"> 

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was initiated to address the lack of visibility and coordination in tracking learning requirements across the department. While managers had access to staff learning status through the Learning Portal, my role as a learning coordinator required me to ensure learning completion across the department. However, I lacked visibility into the detailed statuses outlined in the learning roadmap and had to rely on scattered data sources to monitor training progress.</p>
                <p>To address this, I developed a centralised dashboard that streamlined data collection, automated the data clean-up process, and empowered leaders to make data-informed decisions about learning progress and needs.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">The Challenge: Fragmented Tracking and Manual Monitoring</h2>
                <p>The department had no unified system for tracking learning progress. Key issues included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disparate Data Sources:</strong> Learning data was stored across multiple systems and formats, making consolidation cumbersome.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manual Updates:</strong> Tracking was often done through spreadsheets, increasing the risk of errors and outdated information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Oversight:</strong> Without a central overview, the learning coordinator struggled to identify training gaps or monitor compliance effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Justification Tracking:</strong> There was no centralised repository to capture justifications for incomplete learning, making it difficult to account for valid exceptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reactive Planning:</strong> The absence of timely tracking made it difficult to align learning efforts with departmental priorities or performance cycles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These gaps highlighted the need for a streamlined, scalable solution that could be maintained with minimal manual effort.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">My Role & Initiative</h2>
                <p>In response to these challenges, I took ownership of the initiative to improve learning visibility. Leveraging my experience in process optimisation and dashboard design, I initiated the development of a centralised solution in collaboration with the Learning and Development team and team managers.</p>
                <p>The objective was to create a system that was both functional and automated—yet intuitive enough to be used confidently by stakeholders with minimal technical background.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">The Solution: Centralised Dashboard Design</h2>
                <p>The dashboard was developed using Excel, Power Query, SharePoint, and Microsoft Lists, integrating critical data sources into a single point of reference for training status. Key features included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automated Data Refresh:</strong> Power Query was used to fetch and clean data, replacing manual inputs and ensuring more timely updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Role-Based Categorisation:</strong> Learning items were grouped into mandatory, role-specific, and elective categories to support tailored development tracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Tracking Tools:</strong> Conditional formatting, progress indicators, and completion metrics helped users quickly interpret key data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Filterable Views:</strong> Managers could drill down by team, individual, or training type to identify outstanding items and patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Justification Capture:</strong> I created a Microsoft List to collect justifications from staff who could not complete specific learning items. This list was linked to the dashboard using Power Query, mapping justifications to individual staff records for clearer accountability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The completed dashboard was hosted on SharePoint to ensure secure access and collaborative use.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">Implementation & Impact</h2>
                <p>Following its pilot phase with selected teams, the dashboard demonstrated immediate value. Managers found it easy to navigate and use for planning, while HR reported a reduction in ad-hoc data requests. <strong>Results Achieved:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Oversight:</strong> While the dashboard does not support real-time tracking, its daily manual refresh capability enabled more frequent and timely reporting, improving consistency in follow-ups and discussions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Previously, staff would spend at least four hours performing manual data cleaning, lookups, and consolidation. With automation in place, this was reduced to under an hour—enabling timely decision-making and resource optimisation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> Reduced manual handling significantly improved data integrity, resulting in more reliable and actionable insights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Accountability:</strong> The inclusion of justification tracking increased transparency and made it easier for managers to support staff while ensuring compliance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The dashboard framework was designed to be easily adapted across teams and departments, ensuring long-term applicability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-5">Skills Demonstrated</h2>
